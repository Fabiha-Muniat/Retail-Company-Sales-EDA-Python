## Key Insights: 
- December and January show high sales whereas May-June and November shows low 
sales. For 2015, we can do seasonal advertisement in January and December. We can 
introduce exclusive offers for May-June and November. 
- Salesperson Richard has the highest contribution in total sales. 
- Salesperson Richard has the highest bonus metric. So, Richard is the bonus recipient. 
- Low order priority has the highest average discount. 
- Discounts are not influencing total sales. So, we can reduce discounts. 
- Most of the orders goes by Regular Air. 
- To reduce the shipping cost we can ship the low order priority large product containers 
(Jumbo Box, Jumbo Drum, Large Box) together. 

## Business Recommendation: 
Offering discounts in specific season rather than all over the year may have some impact on the 
total sales. So, we can analyze the discount strategies and offer limited discounts on specific 
products on specific time.
